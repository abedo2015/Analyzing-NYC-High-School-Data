Relationships between demographics and SAT scores

New York City has published data on student SAT scores by their respective high schools, along with other demographic information. The city itself is extremely diverse, so this dataset is a perfect candidate for our investigation into determining whether or not the SAT is a fair test dependant on factors such as race, income, and gender.

For example, if from our analysis we see that certain races consistently produce better results on the tests, then we can somewhat conclude that the SAT is better suited for those select individuals. 

Of course, there can be a plethora of other reasons for certain test scores but the beauty of this form of data analysis is that we can gain a baseline understanding of something that is a very real topic of discussion within many different groups.
